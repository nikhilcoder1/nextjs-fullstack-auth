# Next.js Full Stack Authentication System

A **production-style full stack authentication system** built using **Next.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Mailtrap**.  
This project implements real-world authentication workflows such as secure signup/login, email verification, password reset, and protected routes.

> Designed to closely follow **industry-grade authentication practices** used in modern web applications.

## 📧 Email Testing (Mailtrap) 

1. All authentication-related emails (verification & password reset) are sent to Mailtrap
2. Prevents sending real emails during development
3. Makes testing email workflows safe and reliable
